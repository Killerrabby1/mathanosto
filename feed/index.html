<p>Accidents happen every day in the world. Many things are invented. Many are born and die. Do we remember all the daily events? However, some things are permanently etched in people&#8217;s minds, some events go down in the pages of history. Our regular event &#8216;This Day in History&#8217; deals with such topics. Today is November 23. Let&#8217;s see what happened in the world today. Translated from the book &#8216;On This Day: A History of the World in 366 Days</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.prothomalo.com/prothomalo-bangla%2F2023-11%2Fd8883f56-a8cb-48a1-a7c4-e264984ad2fc%2FColour_Photo_Reuters.jfif?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;fmt=webp&amp;format=webp&amp;w=640&amp;dpr=1.3" alt="Color photographs"/></figure>



<p>The journey of color photography began with the hands of the French inventor Louis Ducot du Hauron. He invented the technique of adding color to photographs. On November 23, 1868, he patented the technique. This invention revolutionized the world of color photography.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First play on stage</h2>



<p>The time is 543 BC. The first play was staged in ancient Greece on November 23 of that year. A man named Thespis from the island of Icaria took the stage for the first time to perform.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Netherlands gets its first female ruler</h2>



<p>In the Netherlands, women were once not allowed to be rulers. After the death of King William III, the country fell into crisis. He left no male heir. Therefore, the country&#8217;s constitution should be amended. On this day in 1890 a new law was passed. Princess Wilhelmina, daughter of King William III, took the throne under this law. She became the queen when she was only 10 years old.</p>

<p>Sam Altman has returned to the position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of OpenAI, the inventor of ChatGPT, after a few days of drama. A day later, he dismissed the board of directors of the company.</p>



<p>Earlier on Friday, the board of directors removed Sam from the post of CEO. Later, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that Sam would join his company.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, more than seven hundred employees of OpenAI told the board of directors in an open letter that if Sam is not returned, they will also quit their jobs. Soon after, Sam was brought back as CEO by OpenAI.</p>



<p>Upon his return as CEO, Sam fired all but one of OpenAI&#8217;s board of directors. Just survive Adam D&#8217;Angelo. He is the CEO of Quora. Now X-Salesforce Co-CEO Brett Taille and former US Treasury Secretary and Harvard University President Larry Summers can join the board.</p>



<p>In addition, Greg Brockman, co-founder of OpenAI, can join the board. Greg announced his resignation as president of OpenAI last Friday, shortly after Sam lost his job.</p>

<p>Rinku Singh leaves the field with Mukesh Kumar (left) after winning the team<em>AFP</em></p>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.prothomalo.com/sports/cricket/dkxrrso8y6" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Cup race</a> The T20 series started again without being completely cut. In that series, India fielded the second row players. There are not many world winners in the Australian team either. Among those who were, Travis Head, Adam Zampa, Glenn Maxwell also stayed out of the field today. However, Visakhapatnam was gifted with a thrilling match that ended with the last ball. India won the match by 2 wickets after Australia scored 208 runs. This is India&#8217;s highest run chase win in T20Is. Earlier in 2019, Indians won by 207 runs against West Indies in Hyderabad.</p>



<p>The drama happened in the last over. India needed 7 runs in the last over, with 5 wickets in hand. Rinku Singh made things easier with a four off Sean Abbott&#8217;s first ball. After 1 bye from the next ball, India need 2 runs from the last 4 balls. After that, India lost three wickets in a row.</p>



<p>On the third ball of the over, Akshar Patel lofted the ball to the bowler Abbott&#8217;s return catch. Ravi Bishnoi is run out on the next ball. Arshdeep Singh is also run out when the equation is 2 runs in 2 balls. However, the Indian pacer conceded 1 run before the out. Rinku got the strike back. IPL Matano batsman hit the last ball for a six. But that six was not added as Ringkur. Be that as it may, the ball was a no ball. The match is over before Rinku hit six!</p>



<p>Rinkuk had to return with 22 unbeaten runs from 14 balls as it did not come as a six. The hero of India&#8217;s victory, however, was Suryakumar. Returning to his favorite version, the acting captain of India played an innings of 80 runs off 42 balls. Surya hit 9 fours and 4 sixes when India returned to score 194 for 5 in 17.4 overs. From there, India had to play till the last ball to match the equation of 15 runs in 14 balls.Read moreDravid is not renewing the contract, Laxman can be the new coach of India</p>



<p>In the run chase, India lost their first wicket on the fifth ball. Ruturaj Gaikwad was run out before a single ball was played. When another opener Yasswi Jaiswal returned with 21 runs from 8 balls, India&#8217;s run was 22 runs in 2.3 overs. From there, Surya&#8217;s partnership of 112 runs with Ishan Kishan. Wicketkeeper batsman Kishan scored 58 runs in 39 balls with 5 sixes. After the departure of Kishan for 134 runs and Tilak Varma for 154 runs, Surya made a partnership of 40 runs with Rinku. Rinku later completed the captain&#8217;s unfinished business.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Holt was a pretty innocent bunch. Lived in Hinsdale, New Hampshire, USA. He used to maintain a mobile home there. The man&#8217;s life, though very simple, was interesting.</p>



<p>The urbane Halt walked around in shabby clothes. He used to go wherever he wanted on a lawnmower. He used to stop the car beside the main road and read the newspaper or sit and watch the movement of other cars.</p>



<p>Holt also did small jobs for others. But rarely went out of town. Even though he taught high school students to drive, he once left the car and rode a bicycle. And finally he started driving the lawnmower. His mobile home in the park was sparsely furnished. There was no television, computer. The condition of his bed was also not good.</p>



<p>Edwin Smith, Holt&#8217;s closest friend, said he thought he would get what he wanted. But he never asked for more.</p>



<p>Holt died earlier this year. Then his secret information came out. He was the owner of about 38 lakh US dollars (42 crore 59 lakh rupees). He gave all his wealth to 4 thousand 200 residents of this city.</p>



<p>Steve Diorio, chairperson of the city&#8217;s Board of Elections, said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think anyone realized that Holt was so successful.&#8221; I know he had no family. Yet to leave (so much wealth) to the people of the city where he lived&#8230; is a great gift.&#8217;</p>



<p>Various proposals are coming with this money expenditure. Some say the money could be spent on hiking, fishing, small businesses, and donating the holt. Others say, fix the city hall clock, restore the building. Some even offered to buy new vote counting machines in Holt&#8217;s honor. Because Holt always wanted to secure votes. Another could be an online driving education course.</p>



<p>City Administrator Kathryn Lynch said Hinsdale will use the money Holt left behind with great care.</p>
