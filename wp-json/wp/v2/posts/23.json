In that series, India fielded the second row players. There are not many world winners in the Australian team either. Among those who were, Travis Head, Adam Zampa, Glenn Maxwell also stayed out of the field today. However, Visakhapatnam was gifted with a thrilling match that ended with the last ball. India won the match by 2 wickets after Australia scored 208 runs. This is India&#8217;s highest run chase win in T20Is. Earlier in 2019, Indians won by 207 runs against West Indies in Hyderabad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drama happened in the last over. India needed 7 runs in the last over, with 5 wickets in hand. Rinku Singh made things easier with a four off Sean Abbott&#8217;s first ball. After 1 bye from the next ball, India need 2 runs from the last 4 balls. After that, India lost three wickets in a row.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the third ball of the over, Akshar Patel lofted the ball to the bowler Abbott&#8217;s return catch. Ravi Bishnoi is run out on the next ball. Arshdeep Singh is also run out when the equation is 2 runs in 2 balls. However, the Indian pacer conceded 1 run before the out. Rinku got the strike back. IPL Matano batsman hit the last ball for a six. But that six was not added as Ringkur. Be that as it may, the ball was a no ball. The match is over before Rinku hit six!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rinkuk had to return with 22 unbeaten runs from 14 balls as it did not come as a six. The hero of India&#8217;s victory, however, was Suryakumar. Returning to his favorite version, the acting captain of India played an innings of 80 runs off 42 balls. Surya hit 9 fours and 4 sixes when India returned to score 194 for 5 in 17.4 overs. From there, India had to play till the last ball to match the equation of 15 runs in 14 balls.Read moreDravid is not renewing the contract, Laxman can be the new coach of India<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the run chase, India lost their first wicket on the fifth ball.
