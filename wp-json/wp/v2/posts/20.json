Lived in Hinsdale, New Hampshire, USA. He used to maintain a mobile home there. The man&#8217;s life, though very simple, was interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The urbane Halt walked around in shabby clothes. He used to go wherever he wanted on a lawnmower. He used to stop the car beside the main road and read the newspaper or sit and watch the movement of other cars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holt also did small jobs for others. But rarely went out of town. Even though he taught high school students to drive, he once left the car and rode a bicycle. And finally he started driving the lawnmower. His mobile home in the park was sparsely furnished. There was no television, computer. The condition of his bed was also not good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edwin Smith, Holt&#8217;s closest friend, said he thought he would get what he wanted. But he never asked for more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holt died earlier this year. Then his secret information came out. He was the owner of about 38 lakh US dollars (42 crore 59 lakh rupees). He gave all his wealth to 4 thousand 200 residents of this city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve Diorio, chairperson of the city&#8217;s Board of Elections, said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think anyone realized that Holt was so successful.&#8221; I know he had no family. Yet to leave (so much wealth) to the people of the city where he lived&#8230; is a great gift.&#8217;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Various proposals are coming with this money expenditure. Some say the money could be spent on hiking, fishing, small businesses, and donating the holt. Others say, fix the city hall clock, restore the building. Some even offered to buy new vote counting machines in Holt&#8217;s honor. Because Holt always wanted to secure votes. Another could be an online driving education course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>City Administrator Kathryn Lynch said Hinsdale will use the money Holt left behind with great care.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Geoffrey Holt was a pretty innocent bunch.
